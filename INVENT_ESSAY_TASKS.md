1. Evaluate the visual unity of the photograph by examining whether the lighting, color temperatures, and environment are all telling the same story. Determine if the light and the setting cooperate to create a single coherent mood and sense of place, or if they pull in opposing directions — such as harsh cool light clashing with a warm cozy background, or soft intimate surroundings disrupted by sharp unflattering shadows. The goal is to detect whether the viewer's eye can move through the frame without friction, or whether competing visual forces create a feeling of tension and dissonance between elements that should be working together.

2. Evaluate the subject belonging of the cat within the photograph by examining whether the cat appears to naturally inhabit its setting rather than being marginalized or treated as an afterthought. Determine if the composition presents the cat as the welcomed center of the scene — a creature that looks like it lives in and has chosen its place within the environment — or if the cat is squeezed into a corner, lost in an overwhelming or visually loud space, or made incidental by a frame that does not seem to care about it. The goal is to judge whether the setting feels built around the cat or whether the cat feels like a small, overlooked presence within a scene that belongs to something else.

3. Evaluate the warmth of invitation conveyed by the photograph as a whole by examining whether the overall mood draws the viewer in with quiet welcome or holds them at a distance. Determine if the coherence of the visual elements — color palette, atmosphere, and the interplay of the living cat with its surroundings — creates a feeling that is hospitable, lived-in, and alive, or if the scene feels sterile, cold, clinical, or emotionally flat. The goal is to judge whether the photograph makes the viewer want to stay and look a little longer, or whether it leaves them indifferent despite any technical competence its individual parts may possess.
