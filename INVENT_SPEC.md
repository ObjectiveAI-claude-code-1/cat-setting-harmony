Evaluate the overall harmony between the cat subject and its surrounding visual setting in a photograph. Step back from the individual dimensions of lighting and background and score whether the photograph, taken as a whole, feels harmonious — whether light and environment are not just individually acceptable but are working together to create a coherent, inviting visual experience where the cat feels like it belongs.

Harmony is the quiet relationship between all elements of the frame. A cat sitting in a patch of warm sunlight on a wooden floor has harmony — the light, the setting, and the subject all belong to the same moment. A cat on a windowsill with soft diffused light and a simple view behind it has harmony. The elements cooperate rather than clash.

Score poorly when disharmony is present:
- Good lighting undermined by a visually aggressive background, where strong light cannot save the image from visual chaos behind the cat
- A clean background sabotaged by poor lighting, where the cat is barely visible despite an uncluttered setting
- Unwelcoming color temperatures that make the scene feel cold, sterile, or uninviting
- Compositions that marginalize the cat within the frame — squeezing it into a corner while empty or distracting space dominates
- Settings so sterile and artificial that the warmth of the living animal is lost
- Any combination where the individual qualities of light and background pull in conflicting directions

Score highly when harmony is present:
- Light and background work together seamlessly to present the cat as the welcomed subject of a coherent scene
- The photograph feels like a natural, unified moment rather than a collision of competing visual forces
- The cat appears to belong in its environment — the visual world around it supports rather than rejects the subject
- Color temperatures, spatial composition, and overall mood create a sense of quiet invitation for the viewer

This is the most holistic of the three evaluations. It captures the emergent quality that arises when light and environment cooperate — or the tension that appears when they do not. A photograph where both lighting and background are merely adequate but work in beautiful concert should outscore one where lighting is excellent but the setting undermines it, or vice versa. The central question is: does this photograph feel like a place where a cat can be seen and appreciated?
